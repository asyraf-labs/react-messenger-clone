### **React JS** is build by *Facebook* and can be used as a base in the development of *single-page* or *mobile applications.*

### **Firebase** is build by *Google* and this is a Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync between your users in realtime🔥


## **Dependencies to run the file as localhost in you computer.**
### 1. Default node modules which comes when you create a new react application.
### 2. Open cmd and direct to this folder or open this folder in Visual Studio Code and open the terminal, run the following codes:
            npm install @material-ui/core
            npm i firebase
            npm i -S react-flip-move
            npm install @material-ui/icons

### 3. To work with Firebase you should already have an account created in firebase, if not make one and follow it's instructions to make sure you are connected to it.

### 4. If you are a new user to firebase run in terminal, 
            npm install -g firebase-tools 
### this has to run only once because it's globally installed, therefore its not necessary to run "npm install -g firebase-tools" if you have alraedy done.


## If you are deploying the application for FIRST TIME, then open the terminal in VS and follow the steps given below:
### In the VS terminal run 
           "firebase init"
           select "Hosting"
           select "using existing project"  ( for this you should have your database created in firebase already )
           select "your created project in firebase"
           enter "build" and select Y
### You will now get a unique URL where you can run your application

## If you made changes to you application and want to deploy again run in VS terminal:
           npm run build
           firebase deploy
